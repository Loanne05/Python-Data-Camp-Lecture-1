#------------------------------------------
#Variable and types
# Create a variable savings
savings=100
# Print out savings
print(savings)

#Calculations with variables
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100
# Create a variable growth_multiplier
growth_multiplier=1.1
# Calculate result
result = savings * growth_multiplier ** 7
# Print out result
print(result)

#Other Variables types
# Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"
# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True

#Operations with other types
savings = 100
growth_multiplier = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"
# Assign product of growth_multiplier and savings to year1
#Calculate the product of savings and growth_multiplier. Store the result in year1.
year1 = savings * growth_multiplier
# Print the type of year1
#What do you think the resulting type will be? Find out by printing out the type of year1.
print(type(year1))
# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
#Calculate the sum of desc and desc and store the result in a new variable doubledesc.
doubledesc = desc + desc
# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)

#Type conversion
# Definition of savings and result
savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7
# Fix the printout
#Fix the code such that the printout runs without errors; use the function str() to convert the variables to strings.
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")
# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = 3.1415926
# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
#Convert the variable pi_string to a float and store this float as a new variable, pi_float.
float(pi_string)
pi_float = pi_string
#pi_float= float(pi_string) same lang yan
